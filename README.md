# Problem Description

An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses.
The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Additionally, the company also gets leads through referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X Education is around 30%.
There are a lot of leads generated in the initial stage, but only a few of them come out as paying customers. In the middle stage, the company nurtures the potential leads (i.e. educating the leads about the product, constantly communicating, etc. ) in order to get a higher lead conversion.
X Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads for follow-up, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.
The Task
Build a model to assign a score between 0 and 100 to leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would indicate that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
